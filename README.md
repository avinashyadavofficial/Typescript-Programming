# TypeScript Programming

Welcome to the **TypeScript Programming** sprint! This sprint is focused on learning and applying Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles using TypeScript. You'll gain hands-on experience with core TypeScript features, OOP design, and best practices for writing scalable, maintainable, and clean code.

---

## Sprint Goals

By the end of this sprint, you will be able to:

- Understand and apply TypeScript types and interfaces
- Implement object-oriented programming concepts using TypeScript classes
- Use access modifiers to control visibility
- Enhance your code with decorators
- Handle exceptions gracefully
- Add logging to monitor your application
- Perform basic File I/O operations
- Follow standard source control practices using Git
- Adhere to coding standards and clean code practices

##Topics Covered

### 1. **Types**
- Basic Types
- Custom Types using `type` and `interface`
- Union and Intersection Types
- Type Assertions and Casting

### 2. **Classes**
- Defining and instantiating classes
- Constructors and class members
- Inheritance and method overriding

### 3. **Interfaces**
- Creating contracts for classes and objects
- Extending multiple interfaces

### 4. **Access Modifiers**
- `public`, `private`, `protected`, `readonly`
- Encapsulation and abstraction

### 5. **Decorators**
- Creating and applying class/method/property decorators
- Real-world use cases like logging and validation

### 6. **Exception Handling**
- Using `try`, `catch`, `finally`
- Creating custom error classes

### 7. **Logging**
- Using `console` for debugging
- Adding structured logs for better traceability

### 8. **File I/O**
- Reading and writing files using Node.js and TypeScript
- Asynchronous vs synchronous operations

### 9. **Source Control Management (SCM)**
- Version control using Git
- Branching, committing, merging, and pull requests
- Writing meaningful commit messages

### 10. **Coding Standards**
- Naming conventions, formatting, and folder structure
- Writing clean, maintainable code

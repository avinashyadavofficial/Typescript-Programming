//Interface can descrive object and classes
// Rule of Thumb
// Use interface when designing the shape of objects, especially for public APIs or OOP-style code.
// Use type when:
// You need union or intersection types
// Youâ€™re working with primitives or tuples
// You need more flexible compositions
